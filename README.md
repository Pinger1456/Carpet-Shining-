## About

The **Shining Carpet Pattern Generator** uses Python to create a repeated, text-based design inspired by the carpet seen in *The Shining*. The pattern can be customized by specifying horizontal (`x_repeat`) and vertical (`y_repeat`) repetitions.

---

## Features

- Generate a customizable, text-based carpet pattern.
- Modular design for easy extension and reuse.
- Fully tested with `unittest` framework.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shining-carpet.git
   cd shining-carpet
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the project from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the pattern by modifying the `x_repeat` and `y_repeat` values in the `main.py` file.

## Testing

The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the carpet generation and output logic. To run the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

All tests are located in the `tests/` directory and use the `unittest` module.
